# Notes
## A place to put all your notes from various modules

# Using Git
## To `clone` this repository:
- Enter a terminal
- `git clone https://github.com/CS2023/Notes`
- cd Notes

## To `push`
- Go to parent directory of the repository (command `pwd` shows "Notes" at the end)
- Run the command `git add .` (this adds all files created (**not empty folders, though) from where you are, down the directory tree to git
- Run the command  `git commit`
- This will then show a text editor, where you add the message of what you added to the repository
- Exit the editor after saving and run the command `git push`

## You may need to give git credentials when you make your first commmitment with git, to do so:
## `git config --global user.email "youremail@here.com"`
## `git config --global user.name "your name here"`

Enjoy learning and using git ;p
